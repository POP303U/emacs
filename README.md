# Simple emacs configuration (WIP)

This configuration is based on tsoding's emacs configuration, [his dotfiles](https://github.com/rexim/dotfiles/tree/master)
It is still in progress and unfinished!

What i want to make it look like:
![Sa_9__Dez_20_18_41_CET_2023_](https://github.com/POP303U/dotfiles/assets/115036828/950584e9-bb6f-478f-b255-e7016bcbac3e)

Basically just a tsoding ripoff lol (maybe with lsp)
